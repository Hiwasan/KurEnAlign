Meanwhile, it is said, again a guest came to Sultan Mahmud.
When his guest arrived, what did the guest do?
He had a little quantity of mud with him;
he had an apple with him;
and he had a pomegranate with him.
He had put the apple beside himself
and had put the heap of the mud in front of himself,
and had put the pomegranate in front of himself.
All three.
No matter how much they would say “What do you have to do with this pomegranate, and what do you have to do with this apple;
what business are you up to and why have you come?”
It was not clear to anybody.
Heyas said: “I am thinking of some person, he is a weaver.
He is very wise.
Let me go (and) ask that person.”
Well, he got up (and) went to the weaver.
He said: “O weaver, a guest has come to us in this state and in this shape.
And we do not know why he has come.”
He said: “Well, how come you do not know? You do not know?”
He said: “No, by God, we do not know.”
He has a little quantity of mud with him in a bag,
he has an apple, and he has a pomegranate too.
He said: “This (man) says that the king has a daughter.
If he does not give me that girl, I shall take his soil in bags.
